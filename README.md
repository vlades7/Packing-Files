# Packing-Files
A small program for automatically distributing files to folders in the current directory

### The program only works with the current directory!

Designed to distribute a bunch of photos in separate folders. 
Lets you specify the name of folders in the format "PrefixIteratorSuffix", where the iterator starts with one.
It is possible to select the number of files to be placed in one folder.
If there is a folder with the generated name, a new name is generated with the next iterator value.
